Sure! I‚Äôve reviewed the GitHub project [**Multi-Agent Stock Analysis Recommendation**](https://github.com/Tejas3103/Advanced-RAG-Project/tree/master/Multi-Agent%20Stock%20Analysis%20recommendation), and here is a complete `README.md` file you can use to describe it effectively on GitHub:

# üìä Multi-Agent Stock Analysis Recommendation System

Welcome to the **Multi-Agent Stock Analysis Recommendation** system ‚Äî an innovative, AI-powered framework that leverages multiple intelligent agents to analyze stock data and provide informed investment recommendations. This project is a sub-module of a larger [Advanced RAG Project](https://github.com/Tejas3103/Advanced-RAG-Project), and showcases how **multi-agent collaboration** can supercharge financial decision-making.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This system implements a **multi-agent architecture** using `langgraph` to simulate financial analysts, researchers, risk managers, and senior advisors. Each agent processes relevant data and interacts with others to contribute toward a well-rounded investment recommendation.

The agents use **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques to fetch contextually relevant stock information, combining LLM-based reasoning with factual data retrieval.

---

## üß† Key Features

- ü§ñ **Multiple Expert Agents**: Includes agents like Analyst, Researcher, Risk Manager, and Senior Advisor.
- üîÑ **Collaborative Decision Making**: Agents communicate and reason through a shared context to arrive at a final recommendation.
- üìà **Stock Market Intelligence**: Uses stock data, financial news, and risk metrics to generate insights.
- üìö **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Fetches relevant external knowledge to ground agent responses.
- üì¶ Built with **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and other cutting-edge AI tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- üß† **LangGraph** - For agent orchestration and graph-based reasoning
- üìö **LangChain** - To integrate retrieval and tool use
- üîç **OpenAI GPT** - LLM backend for intelligent agent responses
- üìä **YFinance / APIs** - For stock data retrieval
- üêç **Python 3.10+**

## üß™ How It Works

1. **Input**: User submits a query like "Should I invest in Tesla (TSLA)?"
2. **Retrieval**: Agents gather contextual knowledge from the RAG pipeline.
3. **Agent Collaboration**:
   - üìë *Researcher* gathers background info and trends
   - üìâ *Risk Manager* assesses financial risks
   - üí° *Analyst* synthesizes insights
   - üßì *Senior Advisor* consolidates and provides the final recommendation
4. **Output**: A final investment recommendation with reasoning

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- OpenAI API key
- Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üèÉ Run the App

```bash
python main.py
```

Then follow the prompts to ask investment-related questions.

## üß† Example Query

> **User:** "Is NVIDIA a good stock to invest in for long-term growth?"

> **Output (Summarized):**  
> After analyzing market trends, financials, risk profile, and future prospects, our agents recommend a **moderate-to-high confidence BUY** rating on NVIDIA for long-term investors. ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider market volatility in the short term.
